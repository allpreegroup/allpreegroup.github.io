<div class="section">
 <h1>Legal Positioning: Regulatory Compliance</h1>

<p>This document outlines Allpree’s legal and financial structure to ensure alignment with regulatory frameworks and consumer protection standards.</p>

<h2>1. Nature of the Business</h2>
<p>Allpree operates a voucher-based digital gift card platform in partnership with GiftMe. Users purchase preset-value gift cards with a built-in markup.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The full amount paid includes both the voucher face value (e.g., J$20,000) and a fixed uplift (e.g., 25%).</li>
  <li>The face value is instantly loaded and redeemable at participating merchants via GiftMe’s infrastructure.</li>
  <li>The uplift is recognized as company income upon sale.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Savings Program Overview</h2>
<p>Savings are offered as a promotional loyalty incentive:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Earned as a percentage of voucher value based on user membership tier.</li>
  <li>Activated by any in-store purchase using the Allpree card.</li>
  <li>Paid after a fixed 121-day accumulation period, at month end.</li>
  <li>Treated as a marketing reward, not as stored value, deposits, or redeemable balances.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. User Funds & Financial Handling</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Allpree does not hold funds on behalf of users.</li>
  <li>Voucher face values are managed by GiftMe, a licensed third-party gift card issuer.</li>
  <li>The uplift is company revenue, a portion of which is earmarked to fund promotional savings payouts.</li>
  <li>Savings are recorded as a deferred liability in the company’s accounting system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Savings Reserve: Structure & Safeguards</h2>
<p>The Savings Reserve is an internal accounting provision used exclusively to fulfill savings obligations promised at voucher purchase.</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is <strong>not a user fund, wallet, or pooled account</strong>, but a company-managed reserve.</li>
  <li>Savings are calculated solely as a rebate from the company’s uplift and disbursed only after a 121-day eligibility period, per defined terms.</li>
  <li><strong>No user deposits</strong> are accepted into the system.</li>
  <li>No interest, returns, or ROI are promised or implied to users.</li>
  <li>Savings are earned through participation in a <strong>closed promotional loyalty system</strong>, not as a return on invested capital.</li>
  <li>The reserve is regularly audited and matched by internal capital allocations to ensure all liabilities are covered.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Savings Fund: Internal Float Management</h2>
<p>Allpree allocates a portion of company-held capital, including uplift revenue and brand sponsorship income, into an internal liquidity pool known as the Savings Fund.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This fund supports the sustainability of savings payouts during the 121-day holding period.</li>
  <li>It operates under strict internal controls, with capped risk exposure and no user funds invested.</li>
  <li>A significant share of any profits generated is recycled back into the Savings Reserve to reinforce payout capacity.</li>
  <li>The Savings Fund is strictly an operational tool, it does <strong>not</strong> create an investment relationship with users and is not accessible to them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Deals & Brand Sponsorships</h2>
<p>Brands generate revenue for Allpree by purchasing exposure through:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Subscription-based promotional plans.</li>
  <li>Short-term featured deal placements.</li>
  <li>Performance-based affiliate fees tied to voucher redemption and usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Portions of these revenues contribute to the internal Savings Fund and Savings Reserve, further supporting user savings obligations and system sustainability.</p>

<h2>7. Compliance & Licensing</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The platform is not a money transmitter or e-wallet.</li>
  <li>Allpree holds no user funds beyond its promotional obligations.</li>
  <li>Savings qualify as a discretionary loyalty reward, not a redeemable asset.</li>
  <li>Terms of Service explicitly define the nature and limits of the savings program.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Risk Management & Consumer Protections</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Savings terms (activation, timing, expiry) are transparent and user-facing.</li>
  <li>No early access or transfer of savings, reducing exposure.</li>
  <li>The Savings Reserve is tracked and managed separately within company accounts to ensure delivery of all promised rewards.</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Tax Treatment</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Uplift and membership fees are treated as revenue.</li>
  <li>Savings are recorded as a marketing expense or deferred liability.</li>
  <li>Returns from internal float management are recognized as company income.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Allpree’s Savings Reserve model is structured as a consumer loyalty program, <strong>not a financial service</strong>. This ensures regulatory clarity while delivering value to users and partner brands.</p>
