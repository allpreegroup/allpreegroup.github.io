    <h1>Cashback Policy Terms</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 7/19/2025</p>

<h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>Allpree offers a cashback reward on select voucher purchases as part of our loyalty program. By purchasing a voucher through Allpree, you agree to the terms below governing eligibility, timing, and payout of cashback.</p>

  <h2>2. Voucher Purchase & Markup</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Allpree vouchers are sold at a <strong>25% markup</strong>.</li>
    <li>Example: A J$20,000 voucher is sold for J$25,000.</li>
    <li>The <strong>entire face value</strong> (J$20,000) is immediately loaded onto your Allpree Gift Card for use in-store.</li>
    <li>The markup funds the cashback system and is <strong>non-refundable</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Cashback Eligibility</h2>
  <p>Cashback is earned when you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Use your Allpree Gift Card</strong> to make <strong>at least one</strong> in-store purchase at a participating merchant.</li>
    <li>This purchase must occur within <strong>121 days</strong> of the voucher purchase.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Cashback Amount</h2>
  <p>Cashback percentages vary based on your membership tier:</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Tier</th>
      <th>J$10K Voucher</th>
      <th>J$15K Voucher</th>
      <th>J$20K Voucher</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Free</strong></td>
      <td>30%</td>
      <td>30%</td>
      <td>30%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Standard</strong></td>
      <td>33%</td>
      <td>34%</td>
      <td>36%</td>
    </tr>

      <td>37%</td>
      <td>41%</td>
      <td>49%</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p><em>Cashback is always calculated based on the voucher’s face value, not the total paid.</em></p>

  <h2>5. Cashback Payout Timing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>After you make your qualifying in-store purchase, a <strong>121-day countdown</strong> begins.</li>
    <li>Cashback is paid via bank transfer at the <strong>end of the calendar month</strong> following that period.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Voucher bought: Jan 1</li>
    <li>In-store use: Jan 10</li>
    <li>121 days ends: May 10</li>
    <li>Cashback paid: <strong>By end of May</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Non-Transferable</h2>
  <p>Cashback rewards are non-transferable and only redeemable by the original purchaser. They cannot be exchanged, sold, or converted to other forms of credit.</p>

  <h2>7. Inactive Accounts</h2>
  <p>If no in-store purchase is made within 121 days, the cashback will not be earned. No partial cashback is given for unused vouchers or missed eligibility.</p>

  <h2>8. Fraud & Abuse</h2>
  <p>Allpree reserves the right to cancel cashback rewards if fraud, abuse, or misuse is suspected.</p>

  <h2>9. Policy Updates</h2>
  <p>These terms may change periodically. The terms that apply are those in effect on the date of voucher purchase.</p>

  </div>

<div class="section">

  <h1>Legal Positioning: Regulatory Compliance</h1>

 
    <h2>1. Nature of the Business</h2>
    <p>Allpree operates a <strong>voucher-based digital gift card platform</strong> in partnership with GiftMe, allowing users to purchase preset-value vouchers with an embedded markup.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Users pay a <strong>total price</strong> inclusive of the voucher’s face value plus a <strong>fixed markup (e.g., 25%)</strong>.</li>
      <li>The voucher value (e.g., J$20,000) is <strong>immediately loaded and redeemable at partner merchants</strong>.</li>
      <li>The markup portion (e.g., J$5,000) constitutes <strong>company revenue</strong> at point of sale.</li>
    </ul>
  

  
    <h2>2. Cashback Program Description</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cashback is offered as a <strong>loyalty incentive</strong>, calculated as a <strong>percentage of the voucher value</strong>.</li>
      <li>Cashback is <strong>conditional</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>Must be activated by a <strong>minimum in-store spend</strong> (any amount).</li>
          <li>Paid <strong>only after a fixed holding period</strong> (e.g., 121 days).</li>
          <li>Cashback is <strong>paid monthly</strong> following the holding period.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Cashback is a <strong>promotional rebate</strong>, <strong>not a deposit or stored value</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  

  
    <h2>3. Financial Position of User Funds</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Allpree <strong>does not hold user funds</strong> as a deposit or fiduciary.</li>
      <li>The <strong>voucher face value</strong> is managed by GiftMe and partner merchants, not Allpree.</li>
      <li>The <strong>markup is company income</strong> immediately upon voucher purchase.</li>
      <li>Cashback amounts are accounted for as <strong>deferred promotional liabilities</strong>, backed by a segregated internal reserve.</li>
    </ul>
 

  
    <h2>4. Compliance &amp; Licensing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The business model <strong>does not constitute a money transmission service or e-wallet</strong>.</li>
      <li>No funds are held on behalf of users beyond the voucher’s face value managed by GiftMe.</li>
      <li>The cashback program is <strong>classified as a consumer loyalty scheme</strong> and thus <strong>exempt from money services licensing</strong>.</li>
      <li>Allpree maintains clear terms of service disclaiming any deposit relationship.</li>
    </ul>
 

 
    <h2>5. Risk Management &amp; Consumer Protection</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cashback payout timing and conditions are <strong>transparent and clearly communicated</strong>.</li>
      <li>The cashback reserve is <strong>segregated and tracked</strong> to ensure obligations are met.</li>
      <li>Early withdrawal or transfer of cashback is <strong>not permitted</strong>, reducing liquidity risk.</li>
    </ul>
 

  
    <h2>6. Tax Treatment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Markup and membership fees are treated as <strong>company revenue</strong>.</li>
      <li>Cashback payouts are <strong>recognized as marketing expenses or deferred liabilities</strong> until paid.</li>
      <li>Investment income generated via the cashback float is treated as <strong>company income</strong>.</li>
    </ul>



    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Allpree’s Cashback Reserve model is structured as a <strong>retail loyalty program</strong> integrated into a voucher purchase flow, <strong>avoiding classification as a financial institution</strong> or deposit-taking entity. This positioning supports regulatory compliance and sustainable operation within the Jamaican and international markets.</p>
