    <h1>Cashback Policy Terms</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 7/19/2025</p>

<h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>Allpree offers a cashback reward on select voucher purchases as part of our loyalty program. By purchasing a voucher through Allpree, you agree to the terms below governing eligibility, timing, and payout of cashback.</p>

  <h2>2. Voucher Purchase & Markup</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Allpree vouchers are sold at a <strong>25% markup</strong>.</li>
    <li>Example: A J$20,000 voucher is sold for J$25,000.</li>
    <li>The <strong>entire face value</strong> (J$20,000) is immediately loaded onto your Allpree Gift Card for use in-store.</li>
    <li>The markup funds the cashback system and is <strong>non-refundable</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Cashback Eligibility</h2>
  <p>Cashback is earned when you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Use your Allpree Gift Card</strong> to make <strong>at least one</strong> in-store purchase at a participating merchant.</li>
    <li>This purchase must occur within <strong>121 days</strong> of the voucher purchase.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Cashback Amount</h2>
  <p>Cashback percentages vary based on your membership tier:</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Tier</th>
      <th>J$10K Voucher</th>

    </tr>
  </table>
  <p><em>Cashback is always calculated based on the voucher’s face value, not the total paid.</em></p>

  <h2>5. Cashback Payout Timing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>After you make your qualifying in-store purchase, a <strong>121-day countdown</strong> begins.</li>
    <li>Cashback is paid via bank transfer at the <strong>end of the calendar month</strong> following that period.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Voucher bought: Jan 1</li>
    <li>In-store use: Jan 10</li>
    <li>121 days ends: May 10</li>
    <li>Cashback paid: <strong>By end of May</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Non-Transferable</h2>

 <h1>Legal Positioning: Regulatory Compliance</h1>

<p>
  This document outlines the legal and financial positioning of Allpree’s operations to ensure compliance with relevant regulatory frameworks and consumer protection standards.
</p>

<h2>1. Nature of the Business</h2>
<p>
  Allpree operates a voucher-based digital gift card platform in partnership with GiftMe, allowing users to purchase preset-value vouchers with an embedded markup.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Users pay a total price inclusive of the voucher’s face value plus a fixed markup (e.g., 25%).</li>
  <li>The voucher value (e.g., J$20,000) is immediately loaded and redeemable at partner merchants.</li>
  <li>The markup portion (e.g., J$5,000) constitutes company revenue at point of sale.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Cashback Program Description</h2>
<p>
  Cashback is offered as a loyalty incentive, calculated as a percentage of the voucher value.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cashback is conditional: must be activated by a minimum in-store spend (any amount).</li>
  <li>Paid only after a fixed holding period (e.g., 121 days).</li>
  <li>Cashback is paid monthly following the holding period.</li>
  <li>Cashback is a promotional rebate, not a deposit or stored value.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Financial Position of User Funds</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Allpree does not hold user funds as a deposit or fiduciary.</li>
  <li>The voucher face value is managed by GiftMe, a licensed gift card processor, which holds the face value and manages merchant redemption in accordance with applicable financial regulations and card network agreements.</li>
  <li>The markup is company income immediately upon voucher purchase.</li>
  <li>Cashback amounts are accounted for as deferred promotional liabilities, backed by a segregated internal accounting reserve.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cashback Fund: Internal Float Management</h3>
<p>
Allpree maintains an internal Cashback Fund used strictly for corporate capital management. This fund helps responsibly grow internal float during the 121-day cashback waiting period, improving liquidity and strengthening the company’s ability to meet all user payouts on time.
</p>
<p>
This system operates under strict internal risk controls and uses only company-held capital — no user funds are ever invested. A large portion of profits is recycled back into the Cashback Reserve to reinforce user payouts.
</p>
<p>
The Cashback Fund is not an investment product, nor is it accessible to users. It exists purely to support operational efficiency and safeguard the long-term sustainability of the Allpree ecosystem.
</p>


<h3>Cashback Reserve: Structure & Safeguards</h3>
<p>
  The Cashback Reserve is an internal accounting construct used to track all cashback liabilities owed to users. It is funded primarily from the portion of the markup collected at the time of voucher purchase that is earmarked for cashback payouts. This reserve ensures that promotional obligations are met without relying on future revenue or ongoing user inflows.
</p>
<p>
  Although not a segregated trust or bank account, the Cashback Reserve is systematically tracked, audited, and matched by internal capital allocations to fully cover deferred liabilities. Its design ensures user entitlements are reliably funded, making the cashback system financially sound and regulatorily compliant.
</p>

<h2>4. Compliance & Licensing</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The business model does not constitute a money transmission service or e-wallet.</li>
  <li>No funds are held on behalf of users beyond the voucher’s face value managed by GiftMe.</li>
  <li>The cashback program is classified as a consumer loyalty scheme and thus exempt from money services licensing.</li>
  <li>Allpree maintains clear terms of service, disclaiming any deposit or financial entitlement relationship, explicitly defining cashback as a discretionary promotional reward.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Risk Management & Consumer Protection</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Cashback payout timing and conditions are transparent and clearly communicated to users.</li>
  <li>The Cashback Reserve is segregated within internal accounting and closely tracked to ensure obligations are met.</li>
  <li>Early withdrawal or transfer of cashback is not permitted, reducing liquidity risk and financial exposure.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Tax Treatment</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Markup and membership fees are recognized as company revenue.</li>
  <li>Cashback payouts are accounted for as marketing expenses or deferred liabilities until paid.</li>
  <li>Investment income generated via the Cashback Fund’s trading float is treated as company income.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
  Allpree’s Cashback Reserve model is structured as a retail loyalty program integrated into a voucher purchase flow, deliberately designed to avoid classification as a financial institution or deposit-taking entity. This positioning supports regulatory compliance and sustainable operation within Jamaican and international markets.
