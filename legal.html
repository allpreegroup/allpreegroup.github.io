    <h1>Cashback Policy Terms</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 7/19/2025</p>

<h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>Allpree offers a cashback reward on select voucher purchases as part of our loyalty program. By purchasing a voucher through Allpree, you agree to the terms below governing eligibility, timing, and payout of cashback.</p>

  <h2>2. Voucher Purchase & Markup</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Allpree vouchers are sold at a <strong>25% markup</strong>.</li>
    <li>Example: A J$20,000 voucher is sold for J$25,000.</li>
    <li>The <strong>entire face value</strong> (J$20,000) is immediately loaded onto your Allpree Gift Card for use in-store.</li>
    <li>The markup funds the cashback system and is <strong>non-refundable</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Cashback Eligibility</h2>
  <p>Cashback is earned when you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Use your Allpree Gift Card</strong> to make <strong>at least one</strong> in-store purchase at a participating merchant.</li>
    <li>This purchase must occur within <strong>121 days</strong> of the voucher purchase.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Cashback Amount</h2>
  <p>Cashback percentages vary based on your membership tier:</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Tier</th>
      <th>J$10K Voucher</th>
      <th>J$15K Voucher</th>
      <th>J$20K Voucher</th>
    </tr>

    </tr>
  </table>
  <p><em>Cashback is always calculated based on the voucher’s face value, not the total paid.</em></p>

  <h2>5. Cashback Payout Timing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>After you make your qualifying in-store purchase, a <strong>121-day countdown</strong> begins.</li>
    <li>Cashback is paid via bank transfer at the <strong>end of the calendar month</strong> following that period.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Voucher bought: Jan 1</li>
    <li>In-store use: Jan 10</li>
    <li>121 days ends: May 10</li>
    <li>Cashback paid: <strong>By end of May</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Non-Transferable</h2>

 <h1>Legal Positioning: Regulatory Compliance</h1>

<p>This document outlines Allpree’s legal and financial structure to ensure alignment with regulatory frameworks and consumer protection standards.</p>

<h2>1. Nature of the Business</h2>
<p>Allpree operates a voucher-based digital gift card platform in partnership with GiftMe. Users purchase preset-value gift cards with a built-in markup.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The full amount paid includes both the voucher face value (e.g., J$20,000) and a fixed markup (e.g., 25%).</li>
  <li>The face value is instantly loaded and redeemable at participating merchants via GiftMe’s infrastructure.</li>
  <li>The markup is recognized as company income upon sale.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Cashback Program Overview</h2>
<p>Cashback is offered as a promotional loyalty incentive:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Earned as a percentage of voucher value based on user membership tier.</li>
  <li>Activated by any in-store purchase using the Allpree card.</li>
  <li>Paid after a fixed 121-day waiting period, at month end.</li>
  <li>Treated as a marketing rebate, not as stored value, deposits, or redeemable balances.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. User Funds & Financial Handling</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Allpree does not hold funds on behalf of users.</li>
  <li>Voucher face values are managed by GiftMe, a licensed third-party gift card issuer.</li>
  <li>The markup is company revenue, a portion of which is earmarked to fund promotional cashback payouts.</li>
  <li>Cashback is recorded as a deferred liability in the company’s accounting system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Cashback Reserve: Structure & Safeguards</h2>
<p>The Cashback Reserve is an internal accounting provision used exclusively to fulfill cashback obligations promised at voucher purchase.</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is <strong>not a user fund, wallet, or pooled account</strong>, but a company managed reserve.</li>
  <li>Cashback is calculated solely as a rebate from the company’s markup and disbursed only after a 121-day eligibility period, per defined terms.</li>
  <li><strong>No user deposits</strong> are accepted into the system.</li>
  <li>No interest, returns, or ROI are promised or implied to users.</li>
  <li>Cashback is earned through participation in a <strong>closed promotional loyalty system</strong>, not as a return on invested capital.</li>
  <li>The reserve is regularly audited and matched by internal capital allocations to ensure all liabilities are covered, enabling Allpree to meet user entitlements without relying on future revenues or external funds.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Cashback Fund: Internal Float Management</h2>
<p>Allpree allocates a portion of company-held capital, including markup revenue and brand sponsorship income, into an internal liquidity pool known as the Cashback Fund.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This fund supports the sustainability of cashback payouts during the 121-day holding period.</li>
  <li>It operates under strict internal controls, with capped risk exposure and no user funds invested.</li>
  <li>A significant share of any profits generated is recycled back into the Cashback Reserve to reinforce payout capacity.</li>
  <li>The Cashback Fund is strictly an operational tool, it does <strong>not</strong> create an investment relationship with users and is not accessible to them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Deals & Brand Sponsorships</h2>
<p>Brands generate revenue for Allpree by purchasing exposure through:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Subscription-based promotional plans.</li>
  <li>Short term featured deal placements.</li>
  <li>Performance-based affiliate fees tied to voucher redemption and usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Portions of these revenues contribute to the internal Cashback Fund and Cashback Reserve, further supporting user cashback obligations and system sustainability.</p>

<h2>7. Compliance & Licensing</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The platform is not a money transmitter or e-wallet.</li>
  <li>Allpree holds no user funds beyond its promotional obligations.</li>
  <li>Cashback qualifies as a discretionary loyalty reward, not a redeemable asset.</li>
  <li>Terms of Service explicitly define the nature and limits of the cashback program.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Risk Management & Consumer Protections</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Cashback terms (activation, timing, expiry) are transparent and user-facing.</li>
  <li>No early access or transfer of cashback, reducing exposure.</li>
  <li>The Cashback Reserve is tracked and managed separately within company accounts to ensure delivery of all promised rewards.</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Tax Treatment</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Markup and membership fees are treated as revenue.</li>
  <li>Cashback is recorded as a marketing expense or deferred liability.</li>
  <li>Returns from internal float management are recognized as company income.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Allpree’s Cashback Reserve model is structured as a consumer loyalty program, <strong>not a financial service</strong>. This approach ensures regulatory clarity and enables Allpree to operate compliantly while delivering value to both users and partner brands.</p>
