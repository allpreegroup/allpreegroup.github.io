    <h2>ðŸŸ¦ Part 1: FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</h2>
    <div class="faq">
      <details><summary>1. How does the cashback gift card system work?</summary><p>You buy a gift card from us at a 25% markup. After 121 days, we send you back up to 49% of the cardâ€™s original value in cash â€” directly to your bank account.</p></details>
      <details><summary>2. Where can I use the gift cards?</summary><p>Gift cards are redeemable at local physical stores listed in the app. You can browse deals, promotions, and store locations right from your phone.</p></details>
      <details><summary>3. Where does the cashback come from?</summary><p>The cashback is funded from our company's profits â€” specifically from trading in the precious metals market using a portion of the markup we collect. Your money is never invested or put at risk.</p></details>
      <details><summary>4. Do I need a membership?</summary><p>No â€” but members get higher cashback. Membership costs $52.60 per year and unlocks the full 49% cashback rate on select cards.</p></details>
      <details><summary>5. What are the cashback tiers?</summary><p>For members:<br>$125 card â†’ 49% cashback<br>$93.93 card â†’ 41% cashback<br>$62.61 card â†’ 37% cashback<br>(All payouts are made 121 days after purchase.)</p></details>
      <details><summary>6. When do I get paid?</summary><p>Exactly 121 days after your gift card purchase, your cashback is sent directly to your linked bank account.</p></details>
      <details><summary>7. Is this a financial product or investment?</summary><p>No. This is not an investment. You are purchasing a retail gift card. Cashback is a loyalty reward funded by our companyâ€™s profits â€” not from your payment.</p></details>
      <details><summary>8. What happens if I donâ€™t use the gift card?</summary><p>Gift cards are valid for use in listed stores â€” even if you donâ€™t use it right away, the cashback payout still occurs after 121 days.</p></details>
      <details><summary>9. Can I see my purchases and payouts?</summary><p>Yes. Your app dashboard will show every gift card you've bought, the expected cashback, and your payout schedule.</p></details>
      <details><summary>10. Will stores pay to be listed in the app?</summary><p>Eventually, yes. For now, listing deals is free for participating stores.</p></details>
      <details><summary>11. How are payouts sent?</summary><p>Payouts are made via bank transfer to your linked Jamaican bank account. Youâ€™ll need to provide your account number and bank name in the app to receive funds.</p></details>
      <details><summary>12. Can I get paid in cash or mobile wallet instead?</summary><p>For now, we only support payouts to Jamaican bank accounts. We may add support for wallets like Lynk or JN Pay later on.</p></details>
      <details><summary>13. Is this available outside Jamaica?</summary><p>No. At this time, cashback rewards are only available to users in Jamaica with a local bank account.</p></details>
